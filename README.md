Tookit for full length transcriptome annotation analysis, including isoform diversity, alternative splicing among transcripts, comparison to known transcriptome, splicing coupling, and their consequences on ORF diveristy. 

* This is part of the rat hippocampus transcriptome annotation project, where hybrid sequencing technology (PacBio + Illumina) was applied to get full-length transcriptome landscape for rat hippocampus.
